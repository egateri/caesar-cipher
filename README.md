### BDD
As a user, I would like to;
1. Have an option to choose either to encrypt a message or decrypt a cipher text.
1. Enter a message or cipher text I want to encrypt or decrypt.
1. Enter a shift key I would like to use to encrypt or decrypt the message.
1. Be able to validate the inputs( - ensure the cipher text and the message do not contain special character and that the shift key is an Integer).  
1. Support both lower case and upper case encryption and decryption.
1. Test the program to ensure there are no bugs and the program is running as expected.
1. Seperate the UI (user Experience) and Business Logic.
